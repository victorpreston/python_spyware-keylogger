# Spyware

This is an advanced keylogger designed to capture keystrokes on a target system and provide remote access to the captured data. It includes a main file for running the keylogger and a remote controller for managing the keylogging process.

## Features

- Captures keystrokes from the user's keyboard
- Saves screenshots in a local folder (`strg`)
- Provides remote control functionalities
- Supports MS Outlook email for sending captured data

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages (specified in `requirements.txt`)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

     ```shell
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/python_spyware-keylogger.git
     ```
    ```shell
       pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```


##Usage

   Open the terminal and navigate to the project directory.

   Run the main file:
   ```shell
      python3 main.py
   ```
   Use the remote controller to manage the keylogger remotely:

   Open the remote_controller.py file.

   Modify the necessary settings, such as the IP address and port for remote access.

   Run the remote controller:
    ```shell
       python3 remote_controller.py
    ```
      This will provide you with options to control the spyware remotely, such as starting or stopping the keylogging process and retrieving captured data.
